                    Initially, I had set up this project without a framework more or less following
                    <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/tailwind-setup/">this article</a>. After
                    getting this base project running and diving into TailwindCSS more I wanted to
                    set up a quick boilerplate so I could have an easy way to showcase all of my
                    demos that I would make for this challenge.
